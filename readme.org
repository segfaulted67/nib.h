* nib.h
** Overview
   Nib.h is a tiny, single-header build system for C projects.
   Inspired by tsoding's [[https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h][nob.h]].
** Features
   - Single-header, drop-in C build system
   - Easy to integrate into existing projects
** Example
   #+begin_src c
   // Example: Demonstrating how to use nib.h in your project
   #define NIB_IMPLEMENTATION
   #include "nib.h"

   int main()
   {
      CMD cmd = { 0 };
      nib_cmd_append(&cmd, "cc", "-o", "main", "main.c");
      if(!nib_cmd_run(cmd))   return 1;
      return 0;
   }
   #+end_src
** Usage
   1. Drop =nib.h= in your project file and write a file =nib.c= with =#define NIB_IMPLEMENTATION= on top
   2. Use =nib_cmd_append(&cmd, ...)= to write your build recipe
   3. Run the recipe with =nib_cmd_run(cmd)=
** Advantages
   - Only depend on your C compiler, no dependency
   - lightweight
   - single header file
** Disadvantages
   - Need to know some C in order to write your build recipe
